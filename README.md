# MallowMals — Cerealsona Personality Quiz

A small web personality quiz that reveals which marshmallow-animal "cerealsona" you are. The quiz is presented as an in-app chat flow and ends by revealing your result (with a character card).

Live demo: open `index.html` in a browser.

## Features
- Conversational quiz UI with branching dialogue
- Six result types (Crumbs, Bits, Puffs, Flakes, Nibs, Pebbles)
- Blind-box / collectible theme and result images
- Floating decorative GIF and icon shower effects

## Files
- `index.html` — main UI and markup
- `script.js` — quiz logic, scoring, UI behaviors
- `IMG/` — artwork and result images (keep filenames referenced in `script.js`)
- audio files (`vibe.mp3`, `ding.mp3`, `pop.mp3`) — UI sounds

## Credits
- Codebase & UI: adapted from I-see Warisa Jaidee — referenced in the UI as @izonfalzo.
- Third-party library:
  - html2canvas (via CDN) — used for screenshot/export functionality.
- Tools:
  - GitHub Copilot — assisted during development for code editing. Copilot helped suggest improvements and perform repetitive edits but final code decisions and testing were made by me.
